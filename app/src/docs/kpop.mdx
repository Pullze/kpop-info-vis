  K-pop music has experienced an unprecedented but extraordinary boom in the last few years.
  From early teenagers to middle-aged people, K-pop has managed to garner fans across different phases of life.

  A key concept in understanding K-pop’s development is “Hallyu (韓流),” meaning “Korean Wave.” This term was created to
  describe the rise of Korean entertainment — music, film, and television — in other Asian countries in the late 1990s.

  Today, Hallyu is spread around the world primarily through the power of the internet, particularly on platforms like
  YouTube. Courtesy of viral TikTok and Instagram challenges, everyone seems to know the latest chartbusters, the
  fandoms, and the chorus, including the hook steps.

  In this article, we will take a journey through time to unravel the evolution of K-pop and how K-pop has captivated
  millions of audiences worldwide in only three decades. K-pop has undergone several transformations, giving rise to
  distinct generations. We will present the five generations in chronological order.

  <Chart spec={HeatMap} />

  ## The 1st Generation
  The first generation of K-pop began in 1992 with the debut of Seo Taiji and Boys. They introduced a new style of music
  that mixed traditional Korean music with hip hop, rap, and rock. Their songs tackled social issues and were highly
  political, a departure from the upbeat and bubblegum pop of the time. The first generation of K-pop laid the
  groundwork for what was to come, introducing new music styles and breaking traditional norms.

  ## The 2nd Generation
  The second chapter for K-pop generations started in a period of economic turbulence in South Korea and they also went
  global. K-pop became one of the most important industries in the country. And while the training system was indeed an
  innovation of the previous era, the marketing and entrepreneurial aspects of K-pop are novelties of this time.

  One of the key groups that defined this generation was Girls’ Generation, which made their debut in 2007. With their
  infectious hit songs and captivating performances, Girls’ Generation captured the hearts of fans globally, solidifying
  K-Pop’s position on the international stage.

  ## The 3rd Generation
  The third generation of K-Pop coincides with the expansion of the genre globally. BTS, EXO, Blackpink, and Twice rose
  to prominence, captivating audiences with their unique concepts, addictive melodies, and stunning visuals. The third
  generation also witnessed the rise of solo artists like Jimin and Taeyeon, who showcased their versatility and
  artistry, further propelling K-Pop’s global domination

  K-POP is dubbed as a “Global Phenomenon”. The popularity of social networks and streaming platforms also contributed
  immensely to this expansion. Groups have started to perform in International Music Festivals and International Award
  Shows.

  >
  > A decade later, nine albums made it onto the Billboard 200, including three releases from BTS. Two of these albums -
  > Love Yourself: Tear and Love Yourself: Answer reached the number one spot and stayed on the chart for over 15 weeks.

  The third generation also witnessed the rise of solo artists like Jimin and Taeyeon, who showcased their versatility
  and artistry, further propelling K-Pop’s global domination.


  ## The 4th Generation
  The ‘most viral generation’ of today is sweeping the maximum benefits from the efforts of artists from previous
  generations. The most popular groups today include Stray Kids, ATEEZ, (G)I-DLE, TXT, ITZY, ENHYPEN, aespa, IVE, LE
  SSERAFIM, and NewJeans. What took years to achieve success in the yesteryears, many 4th generation groups were capable
  of achieving in a matter of a few months.

  K-Pop groups unexpectedly continued to achieve multitudes of success and the attractiveness of K-Pop heightened. Many
  songs started topping global charts, raking in millions of views on YouTube within hours, and multiple albums were
  surpassing 1 million in pre-order sales. Companies began investing millions of dollars to deliver top-class music,
  with escalated focus on choreography, music video production, and fashion

  <Chart spec={GenRank}/>

  > Among the Top 20 K-pop groups and singers with the most Billboard 200 hits, nine are from the 3rd generation, with
  > Twice and Blackpink being the only girl groups. Another nine belong to the 4th generation, evenly divided between
  > three boy bands and three girl groups. The 5th-generation group BoyNextDoor and the 2nd-generation artist G-Dragon
  > each have one entry on the list.

  ## The 5th Generation

  The 5th generation of K-pop occurs around 2023. The 4th generation, defined by its rapid globalization and the rise of
  social media-driven fan engagement, set the stage for the 5th generation to take K-pop to even greater heights.

  Looking ahead, an increasing number of K-pop groups are expected to thrive globally, attracting even larger fanbases.
  In 2024 alone, 23 K-pop idols made it onto the Billboard 200 chart.

  We think it’s safe to say that the K-pop revolution is far from over. The world is hungry for the best entertainment
  that Hallyu has to offer. Just like the British Invasion of the 1960s, the K-pop Invasion is going to continue to
  change music all over the world.
