K-pop music has experienced an unprecedented but extraordinary boom in the last few years. From early teenagers to middle-aged people, K-pop has managed to garner fans across different phases of life.

A key concept in understanding K-pop’s development is “Hallyu (韓流),” meaning “Korean Wave.” This term was created to describe the rise of Korean entertainment — music, film, and television — in other Asian countries in the late 1990s.

Today, Hallyu is spread around the world primarily through the power of the internet, particularly on platforms like YouTube. Courtesy of viral TikTok and Instagram challenges, everyone seems to know the latest chartbusters, the fandoms, and the chorus, including the hook steps.

In this article, we will take a journey through time to unravel the evolution of K-pop and how K-pop has captivated millions of audiences worldwide in only three decades. K-pop has undergone several transformations, giving rise to distinct generations. We will present the five generations in chronological order.

## 1st Generation
The first generation of K-pop began in 1992 with the debut of Seo Taiji and Boys. They introduced a new style of music that mixed traditional Korean music with hip hop, rap, and rock. Their songs tackled social issues and were highly political, a departure from the upbeat and bubblegum pop of the time. The first generation of K-pop laid the groundwork for what was to come, introducing new music styles and breaking traditional norms.

## 2nd Generation
The second chapter for K-pop generations started in a period of economic turbulence in South Korea and they also went global. K-pop became one of the most important industries in the country. And while the training system was indeed an innovation of the previous era, the marketing and entrepreneurial aspects of K-pop are novelties of this time.

One of the key groups that defined this generation was Girls’ Generation, which made their debut in 2007. With their infectious hit songs and captivating performances, Girls’ Generation captured the hearts of fans globally, solidifying KPOP’s position on the international stage.
